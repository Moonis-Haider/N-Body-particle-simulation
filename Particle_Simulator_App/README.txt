A Short Explanation of Moonis Haider's Particle Simulator

The Simulator allows for a variety of settings to be chosen 
Once Chosen, press the "Create World" button to create a world with the desired settings
Press Esc at any time to exit
Now, the settings, one by one

FORCE
Allows for one to choose whether particles have no forces between them,
are attracted by gravity based on mass,
or attracted by electric forces based on charge.
Note that under electric force, all particles will be one of 2 random colours, representing positive and negative

DISTRIBUTION
Allows for the world to be created with particles in a random location with random mass and random colour,
or to be created with the same mass and colour, and in grid spaced locations

STRENGTH OF FORCE
Self descriptory, describes the strength of the force chosen

PARTICLE SIZE (MASS)
Sets the range for a particles mass if its a random distribution,
if the distribution is uniform, than all particles will have the mass halfway between the max and min mass

NUMBER OF ROWS/COLS
Sets the grid used in a uniform distribution,
if the distribution is random, the total number of particles will be the no.rows * no.cols

CHANCE OF NEGATIVE CHARGE
If the world is set to electric force, this sets the chance of it being electric 

To create a particle, left click once to set starting position
Then move and left click again to create it moving in that direction

To delete a particle, go over it and right click
